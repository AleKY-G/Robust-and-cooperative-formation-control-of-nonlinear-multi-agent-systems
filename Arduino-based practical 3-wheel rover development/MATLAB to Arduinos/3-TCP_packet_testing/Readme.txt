Due to the high packet-loss rate of UDP, TCP is used here.
This folder contains the basic test codes for MATLAB to Arduino TCP communication (only from MATLAB to Arduino).
The packet dropout rate is also tested here.
From the experiments, we have that the packet dropout rate is 0 because of the steady handshake structure of TCP.
And a common communication procedure that transmit 9 float numbers is expected to cost 15 ms.
