This folder contains the code for my paper "Neural network adaptive dynamic sliding mode formation control of multi-agent systems". 

Some corrections to make for those who are interested:

1. Equation (39): It should be L(rho_i) - e_{xi}(0)
2. Table 2: The orientation of the first rover should be pi/4
3. The rotation matrix in (42): The element on the second row and the third column should be -cos(pi/3 + theta)

Some changes have been made to fresh up the designs posted several month ago.
Note that the formation reference in the current version is different from the one offered in the original paper.

four_bots_CNN_DSM.slx is for the original design.
four_bots_CNN_DSM_compare.slx is a comparative simulation to see if it is okay to include the hysteresis as a part of the system uncertainty. From simulation, the brutal way works.
hysteresis_phenomenon.slx is the simulink file to illustrate what is a hysteresis phenomenon.

dilute_data.m, draw_the_robot.m and plotting_cnn_design.m are for plotting.

Hope you find it interesting and get some inspiration from it.
