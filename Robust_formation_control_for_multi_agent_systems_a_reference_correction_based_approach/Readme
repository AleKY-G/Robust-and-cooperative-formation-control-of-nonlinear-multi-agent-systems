This is the folder that contains the code for paper "Robust Formation Control for Multi-Agent Systems: A Reference Correction Based Approach".

Here, two comparative simulations are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the algorithms we proposed in the above paper.

Some tips for those that are interested:
1. The file "five_bots_Observer_Obstacle_1_sin_cir_nc.slx" is the simulation for formation control without the reference correction algorithm. 
2. The file "five_bots_Observer_Obstacle_1_sin_cir.slx" is the simulation with the reference correction algorithm.
3. The file "draw_the_robot.m" is a self-written program that help us draw out the omni-directional robot with an input of [x,y,theta].
4. The file "plotting.m" is the file I wrote to draw the figures in my paper.
5. The file "video_test.m" is the file I wrote to have a video illustration of the formation tracking approach.

Hope you enjoy and get some inspiration from my work. :)
